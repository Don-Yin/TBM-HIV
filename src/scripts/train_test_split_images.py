"""
IMPORTANT: 
This script assumes that:
    - the train, validation and test subjects are splitted with their IDs stored in the cache/split.json file
    - all image volumes (to be splitted) are stored in a single folder, named as "IMAGE_FOLDER" (can be adjusted in this script)
    - there is a label.csv file that contains two columns: subject_id and MR

It then splits the images into train, validation and test sets, each stored in a separate folder.
